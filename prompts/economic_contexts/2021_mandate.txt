ElectionContext heading into the September 2021 federal election:
Canada entered the campaign with output finally back to (just) above its 2019 level, but GDP per capita, labour-productivity growth, and private investment were still below pre-pandemic peaks, underscoring widening gaps with the U.S. on most Build Canada tenets (productivity, investment, export scale). Inflation was heating, unemployment was falling but not yet back to 2019 lows, and the federal balance sheet remained deeply in deficit.
