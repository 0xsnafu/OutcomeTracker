- `POST /jobs/batch` - Execute multiple jobs
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/status` - Check job status
- `GET /jobs/history` - View execution history

### Pipeline Management

- `POST /pipeline/reset/{job_name}` - Reset job state

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Deployment ✅
- New pipeline deployed alongside existing scripts
- Configuration validation and testing
- Core infrastructure verification

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
- Start with least critical ingestion jobs
- Validate data consistency between old/new systems
- Monitor performance and error rates

### Phase 3: Processing Migration
- Migrate processing jobs one source at a time
- Compare evidence item quality and completeness
- Ensure LLM integration works correctly

### Phase 4: Linking Migration
- Switch evidence linking to new system
- Validate promise-evidence relationships
- Monitor progress scoring accuracy

### Phase 5: Full Cutover
- Disable old scripts
- Remove deprecated code
- Update Cloud Run deployment

## Scripts to be Deprecated

The following existing scripts will be replaced:

### Ingestion Scripts
- `scripts/processing_jobs/ingest_canada_news.py`
- `scripts/processing_jobs/ingest_legisinfo_bills.py`
- `scripts/processing_jobs/ingest_oic.py`
- `scripts/processing_jobs/ingest_canada_gazette_p2.py`
- All `bulk_*.py` scripts

### Processing Scripts
- `scripts/processing_jobs/consolidated_promise_enrichment.py`
- Individual enrichment scripts
- Manual processing utilities

### Orchestration Scripts
- `cloud_run_main.py`
- `cloudbuild.yaml` (to be updated)

### Linking Scripts
- `scripts/linking_jobs/run_evidence_linking_with_progress_update.py`
- Manual linking utilities

## Success Metrics

### Reliability
