## 🎛️ Configuration Management

### Separation of Concerns

**Google Cloud Console** manages operational settings:
- ⏰ **Scheduling** - Cloud Scheduler cron expressions 
- ⏱️ **Timeouts** - Attempt deadlines per job
- 🔄 **Retries** - Max retry attempts and backoff strategies  
- 🔐 **Authentication** - Service accounts and IAM roles
- 📊 **Monitoring** - Alerting policies and log analysis
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure** - Cloud Run memory, CPU, scaling

**Code Configuration** (`jobs.yaml`) defines application logic:
- 🔧 **Job Classes** - Which Python class to execute
- 🔗 **Triggers** - Downstream job dependencies with smart conditions (`successful_run`, `evidence_updated`)
- ⚙️ **Runtime Settings** - Batch sizes, concurrent job limits
- 📊 **Metadata Passing** - Targeted job execution with specific data (e.g., affected promise IDs)

This separation eliminates configuration duplication and follows Google Cloud best practices.

**Configuration Responsibilities**:
1. **Cloud Scheduler** (Google Cloud Console): When, how often, timeout, retries
2. **jobs.yaml** (Code): Which Python class, what triggers afterward  
3. **Cloud Run** (Google Cloud Console): Memory, CPU, scaling, authentication

### 🛠️ Maintenance Utilities
| Script | Purpose | Typical cadence |
| ------ | ------- | --------------- |
| `scripts/utilities/one-time/reset_evidence_error_statuses.py` | Bulk-reset evidence documents whose `promise_linking_status` is `error_processing` back to `pending`, clearing the error message so the Evidence Linker will re-attempt them. | Ad-hoc, or scheduled daily via Cloud Scheduler & Cloud Run job if desired |
| `pipeline/testing/check_firestore_indexes.py` | Verifies required composite indexes exist (processors rely on them). | Whenever Firestore rules/indexes change |
