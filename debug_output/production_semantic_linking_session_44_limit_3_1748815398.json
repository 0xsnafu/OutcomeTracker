Co-operative housing is seen as a viable solution, offering an alternative to traditional rental and ownership models by providing stable, often more affordable, homes where residents have a collective stake and responsibility. The government aims to leverage this established model to address the housing supply and affordability challenges more broadly across the country.

The Liberal platform acknowledges the need for Indigenous-led solutions, recognizing that past top-down approaches have often failed to address the unique cultural, social, and economic contexts of diverse Indigenous communities. Creating a National Indigenous Housing Centre is presented as a crucial step towards reconciliation and self-determination, aiming to empower Indigenous partners in designing and delivering housing initiatives that truly meet their needs in urban, rural, and northern areas.

By implementing and strengthening a tax on such properties and expanding it to include foreign-owned vacant land, the government aims to discourage speculative buying, encourage properties to be used as homes, and ultimately improve housing access and affordability for Canadians.

Regulations were enacted to amend the Act, addressing health and safety concerns of ultraviolet radiation-emitting and ozone-generating devices (May 2022), and modernizing elements related to applications and imports of pest control products (December 2022). New Biocides Regulations, enacted under the Act, came into force (June 2024), establishing a new regulatory framework. Additionally, an order was made to list specific formulants and contaminants of health or environmental concern under the Act (September 2024). Federal departments also announced next steps for a sustainable approach to pesticide management (June 2023).",
