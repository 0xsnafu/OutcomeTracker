      "background": "This commitment stems from Canada's broader climate change goals and the global push towards a net-zero economy. As outlined in the Liberal platforms, particularly the 2021 'Forward For Everyone' and 2025 'Canada Strong' documents, there's a recognition that transitioning away from carbon-intensive industries will significantly impact specific workers and communities. The government aims to proactively address potential job losses and economic disruption by ensuring that those affected receive adequate support, training, and opportunities in new, sustainable sectors. This policy is designed to make the economic shift equitable, fostering a competitive green economy while mitigating social costs and ensuring no one is left behind in the transition.",
