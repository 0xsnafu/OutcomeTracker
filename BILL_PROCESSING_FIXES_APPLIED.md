# Bill Processing Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
Bills were not processing despite 18 pending items in the `raw_legisinfo_bill_details` collection. Multiple issues were identified and resolved.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Firestore Import in Bill Processor
**Problem:** `LegisInfoProcessor` was using `firestore.FieldFilter` without importing firestore module
**Root Cause:** Missing `from firebase_admin import firestore` import  
**Fix Applied:** Added firestore import in `_get_items_to_process()` method
**Files Changed:** `pipeline/stages/processing/legisinfo_processor.py`

### 2. ✅ Firestore Composite Index Requirement  
**Problem:** Query failed with "The query requires an index" error
**Root Cause:** Filtering by `processing_status` AND ordering by `last_updated_at` requires composite index
**Fix Applied:** Removed `.order_by('last_updated_at')` to eliminate index requirement
**Files Changed:** `pipeline/stages/processing/legisinfo_processor.py`

### 3. ✅ Flask Development Server Warning
**Problem:** Cloud Run was using Flask's development server instead of production WSGI
**Root Cause:** Dockerfile was running `python -m pipeline.orchestrator` directly
**Fix Applied:** 
- Created `wsgi.py` production entry point
- Updated Dockerfile to use `gunicorn` with proper configuration
- Configured Gunicorn with 2 workers, 3600s timeout, proper binding
**Files Changed:** 
- `Dockerfile`
- `wsgi.py` (new file)

### 4. ✅ Circular Import Warning
**Problem:** RuntimeWarning about module import behavior
**Root Cause:** Direct execution pattern in orchestrator causing import conflicts
**Fix Applied:** Restructured orchestrator with proper `main()` function
**Files Changed:** `pipeline/orchestrator.py`

## Verification Results ✅

**Test Run Successful:**
- ✅ Found 10 pending bill items (limit applied correctly)
- ✅ Successfully parsed JSON content from bills
- ✅ Bill inclusion logic working (government bills accepted)
- ✅ No Firestore query errors
- ✅ Bill processing logic functional

**Sample Bill Found:**
- Bill C-2: "An Act respecting certain measures relating to the security of the border between Canada and the United States"
- Status: `pending_processing`
- Parser: ✅ Working
- Should Include: ✅ True

## Expected Outcome

Once deployed to Cloud Run:
1. **18 pending bills** in `raw_legisinfo_bill_details` will be processed
2. **Evidence items** will be created in `evidence_items` collection  
3. **Automatic triggering** of downstream evidence linking jobs
4. **Progress scoring** will follow after linking

## Deployment Status

**Ready for Cloud Run deployment** with:
- ✅ Production WSGI server (Gunicorn)
- ✅ Fixed bill processor imports
- ✅ Resolved circular import warnings
- ✅ Firestore query optimizations
- ✅ All dependencies in `requirements.txt`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Cloud Run** - All fixes are ready for deployment
2. **Monitor pipeline** - Check logs for successful bill processing
3. **Verify evidence creation** - Confirm evidence items are created
4. **Check downstream jobs** - Ensure linking and scoring are triggered
