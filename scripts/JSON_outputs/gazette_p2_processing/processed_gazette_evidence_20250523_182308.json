The changes enable more efficient management of high conservation value lands. Additionally, minor administrative errors in the boundary description of the Prince Edward Point National Wildlife Area are corrected. These regulatory updates support the government's commitments, including the Nature Legacy Initiative from Budget 2018 and the 2019 Speech from the Throne, to protect biodiversity and species at risk in Canada through the establishment and management of National Wildlife Areas."
