As part of the CMP, the Minister of the Environment can apply significant new activity (SNAc) provisions of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). These provisions allow the Minister to request information to assess potential environmental and human health risks when a substance is used in a new way that could alter exposure. This specific Order (2024-87-24-01) amends the Domestic Substances List to apply SNAc provisions to phenol, dimethyl-, phosphate (3:1), also known as “trixylyl phosphate.” The CMP, launched in 2006, aims to reduce risks from industrial releases or product use. Officials from Environment and Health departments conduct assessments under CEPA."
