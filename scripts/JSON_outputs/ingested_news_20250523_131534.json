After 50 years of working together, transcending national differences and promoting global prosperity, the value of the G7 is clear.\nBanff, May  20-22, 2025\nWe, the G7 Finance Ministers and Central  Bank Governors, met on May 20-22, 2025 in Banff, Canada together with the Heads  of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank Group (WBG), Organisation  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and Financial Stability Board  (FSB). We were also joined by Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko and the  President of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for parts of the meeting.\nWe began by reiterating our shared  commitment to the G7. After 50 years of working together, transcending national  differences and promoting global prosperity, the value of the G7 is clear. We  held a productive and frank exchange of views on the current global economic  and financial situation, the risks and opportunities common to our countries,  and ways to address them. This joint statement reflects the outcome of the  discussion between G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors during the  meeting.\nGlobal  Economy\nIn  the face of multiple complex global challenges, we are committed to pursuing  our shared policy objectives. We agree that the G7 can leverage our strong  economic relationships to advance our common goals. International organizations  signaled at our last meeting that trade and economic policy uncertainty was high  and weighing on global growth. We acknowledge that economic policy uncertainty  has declined from its peak, and we will work together to achieve further  progress. We also shared our concerns over unsustainable global macro  imbalances.\nIn  this respect, we also underscore the need to address excessive imbalances and  strengthen macro fundamentals, given potential global spillovers. We call on  the IMF to continue to enhance its analysis of imbalances in both its bilateral  and multilateral surveillance. We continue to engage with each other and with  international partners to advance international cooperation and deliver  prosperity.\nStrong and sustainable economic growth  is the cornerstone of economic prosperity. We are committed to working  together to achieve a balanced and growth-oriented macroeconomic policy mix  that supports our economic security and resilience and ensures that all of our  citizens can benefit from that growth. We are committed to maintaining  well-functioning financial markets. We recognize that elevated uncertainty can  have implications for the economy and for financial stability. We will continue to  monitor and consult closely on these matters. Our central banks remain strongly  committed to ensuring price stability, consistent with their respective  mandates. We reaffirm our May 2017 exchange rate commitments.\nEconomic Resilience and Security\nWe  recognize the need for a common understanding of how non-market policies and  practices (NMPPs) aggravate imbalances, contribute to overcapacity, and impact the  economic security of other countries. Building on our previous commitments and  as guided by Leaders, we will contribute, as appropriate, to the monitoring of  NMPPs, continuing to assess the distortions they cause in markets and their  global spillovers. We agree on the importance of a level playing field and  taking a broadly coordinated approach to address the harm caused by those who  do not abide by the same rules and lack transparency.\nWe  call on international organizations to address data gaps and deepen our  collective understanding of NMPPs and their domestic and global implications.  We agree that joint analysis of market concentration and international supply  chain resilience would be useful areas of future work. This analysis will  inform our respective policy approaches, which will in part be shaped by our  underlying industrial and consumer structures. Where appropriate and relevant,  we will engage partners beyond the G7.\nWe  recognize a significant increase in international low-value shipments being  sent to our economies in a decentralized manner, and the potential for this to  overwhelm and take advantage of customs controls and duty and tax collection  infrastructure. Collectively, we recognize the potential for illicit drug  trafficking, the importation of counterfeit goods, the misclassification of  merchandise, revenue leakage, inequity for our retailers, and significant  environmental waste. We commit to exploring ways that our low-value importation  systems could address these risks.\nSupport for Ukraine\nWe  condemn Russia’s continued brutal war against Ukraine and commend the immense  resilience from the Ukrainian people and economy. Ukraine has suffered significant  destruction. The G7 remains committed to unwavering support for Ukraine in  defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty  and independence toward a just and durable peace.\nWe  welcome ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire. If such a ceasefire is not  agreed, we will continue to explore all possible options, including options to  maximize pressure such as further ramping up sanctions. We  reaffirm that, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign  assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its  aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.\nWe  agree that private sector mobilization will be important in the recovery and  reconstruction of Ukraine, with costs estimated by the WBG at US$524 billion  over the next decade. We collectively commit to help build investor confidence  through bilateral and multilateral initiatives. To this end, in addition to the  ongoing support through the MIGA SURE (Support for Ukraine’s Reconstruction and  Economy) trust fund, we will work, including through the Ukraine Donor  Platform, with the Government of Ukraine, international financial institutions (IFIs),  and the insurance industry towards removing the blanket ban imposed on Ukraine as  soon as possible. We will continue to coordinate support to promote the early  recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine, including at the Ukraine Recovery  Conference, which will take place in Rome on July 10-11, 2025. Further, we agree  to work together with Ukraine to ensure that no countries or entities, or entities from those countries that financed or supplied  the Russian war machine will be eligible to profit from Ukraine’s  reconstruction.\nBolstering  Long-term Growth and Productivity\nWe  agree on the importance of pursuing public policies that spur innovation, raise  productivity and promote greater labour force participation. In an environment  of high public debt and increasing fiscal pressures, we  also agree that raising long-term growth potential is essential to manage risks  to fiscal sustainability and increase wages and living standards.\nWe  discussed and shared experiences on how best to pursue growth-enhancing  policies in a fiscally prudent manner. We agree that structural reforms can  help set the foundations for strong and sustainable economic growth. We recognize that specific growth policies need to be adapted to each  country’s needs and circumstances. We agree that maintaining a stable and  predictable macroeconomic environment is important for strong growth and  productive long-term investment.\nArtificial Intelligence\nWe  deepened our understanding of prospects for AI to raise productivity growth,  and of the policies needed to realize the benefits. We appreciate the framework  provided by the OECD to better quantify and monitor AI-driven productivity  gains. We  recognized the benefits of AI for the financial sector and the need to monitor and  assess potential risks to financial stability as AI adoption further increases.\nFinancial Sector Issues\nWe  are committed to a strong, resilient and stable financial sector. We reiterate that a  continued focus on financial stability and regulatory issues remains vital to ensure the effective functioning  of the financial system. We noted our support for the important work of the FSB  and Standard Setting Bodies. We focused on non-bank financial intermediaries, which  play an increasingly important role in financing the real economy. Their  activities can contribute to the efficiency of financial markets but can also  pose risks to the global financial system. We discussed sources of potential risk,  including those from liquidity mismatch, leverage and interconnectedness. We agree  on the need to assess non-bank data availability, use and quality and to share  knowledge and approaches to monitoring and assessing potential risks.\nEnhancing cross-border payments can  have widespread benefits for citizens and economies worldwide. We remain  committed to delivering cheaper, faster, more transparent and more accessible  cross-border payments while maintaining  their safety, resilience, and financial integrity.  This includes supporting the implementation of the G20 Roadmap as well as appropriate  future actions as necessary to meet these goals.\nCyber  risks threaten to disrupt global financial systems and the institutions that  support them. To address the evolving cyber threat landscape, we will continue  to take action to further strengthen our shared response capabilities and  protocols in the event of a significant cyber incident. We look forward to the  G7 Cyber Expert Group’s assessment of the risks and opportunities that AI  presents for cybersecurity.\nThe  potential effects of quantum technologies on the global financial landscape are  becoming increasingly visible. Our central banks will explore how we can  identify, categorize and mitigate potential risks to data security and  financial stability and promote economic resilience.\nFinancial Crime Call to Action\nWe  remain steadfast in our commitment to tackling financial crime, including money  laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction (AML/CFT/CPF). We endorse a “Financial Crime Call to  Action” to spur further progress and collective efforts of the Financial Action  Task Force (FATF) and its Global Network. By bringing together over 200  jurisdictions around the world, the FATF is the ultimate international standard  setter, and we welcome its leadership in combatting financial crime since its  creation by the G7 in 1989.\nThrough  strengthening our AML/CFT/CPF frameworks and enhanced international cooperation  we will endeavor to stay abreast of emerging risks, understand the role of  technology and deepen the responsible exchange of information to make it harder  for criminals to access the financial system and evade detection.\nWe  recognize financial crime acts as a barrier to growth, development and  stability, and support efforts to strengthen frameworks in lower capacity  countries. We encourage the international community to join us in this Call to  Action and strengthen our collective response to financial crime.\nSupport for Developing Countries\nWe  reaffirm our commitment to the ongoing implementation of the World Bank-led  Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership and  recognize its progress toward better integrating low- and middle-income  countries in the global supply chain of clean energy products, especially in  Africa. We welcome the adoption of a country roadmap in Zambia. We encourage  the World Bank to further advance this initiative, and we look forward to the  launch of the first local and regional information platforms in Africa. We  support the expansion of RISE’s activities to Latin America and the Caribbean,  and a better integration of all segments of the critical mineral supply chain.  We call on Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to strengthen collaboration on  critical mineral supply chains amongst themselves and with other key  stakeholders. We also highlighted linkages to G20 initiatives facilitating  private sector development, such as the G20 Compact with Africa.\nWe  recognize that global crises, including health crises and natural disasters,  pose significant challenges for all economies, with particularly severe impacts  on vulnerable states, including small ones. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening  support for these countries by facilitating domestic resource mobilization as  well as the use and uptake of crisis preparedness and response tools, including  Climate Resilient Debt Clauses and insurance, to help ease fiscal pressures. We  encourage the IMF and MDBs to strengthen their focus on crisis prevention in  order to reduce the incidence of crises materializing.\nWe  call on the international community to make efforts to support vulnerable  countries facing debt challenges. We look forward to the G20 work on improving  the implementation of the Common Framework for debt treatments in a  predictable, timely, orderly, and coordinated manner. We also agree on the  importance of advancing debt transparency to support sound economic governance  and financial stability. We call on the international community to make efforts  to support vulnerable countries whose debt is sustainable but face near-term  liquidity challenges. We recognize the need for continued efforts with all  partners, public and private, to enhance the availability and quality of debt  data, including through the Data Sharing Exercise with the World Bank.\nWe  reaffirm our commitment to achieving more effective and impactful MDBs through reforms  aiming to ensure that they work effectively as a system to address the most  pressing global challenges, deliver on their core mandate, and use their resources  as efficiently as possible, including by implementing the recommendations from  the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework Review. We urge MDBs to continue to step up  their efforts to mobilize private capital and enhance domestic resource  mobilization in emerging markets and developing countries. We emphasize the  importance of implementing quality-based procurement policies and procedures  that promote efficiency, competition from the private sector, and transparency.\nG7 Financial Crime Call to Action\nThe G7  Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors remain steadfast in our commitment  to tackling financial crime, including money laundering, terrorist financing  and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  (AML/CFT/CPF).\nIn 1989, the G7 created the\nFinancial Action Task Force  (FATF) to “prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial  institutions for the purpose of money laundering”\nand was  soon joined by many other countries and jurisdictions which shared the same  concerns and volunteered for a global effort against financial crime. Since its establishment, the  FATF’s mandate and standards have expanded to include the combatting of financing  of terrorism and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The transnational nature of money  laundering, malicious nature of its predicate crimes, and integrated nature of  our economies necessitate a collective approach to combatting illicit finance.  2025 marks  the 35-year anniversary of the FATF’s “40 Recommendations”, which were  developed collectively by FATF members and are now being implemented in more  than 200 jurisdictions worldwide thanks to the joint efforts of the FATF Global  Network.\nThe Intersection of Crime, Security, and Economic Prosperity\nOrganized criminals, including cartels, are exploiting gaps  in global AML safeguards to launder the profits of their criminal activities  such as drug trafficking (including fentanyl and synthetic opioids), fraud,  cybercrimes, and human smuggling that generate billions in illicit revenue  annually. These crimes are not only having a devastating impact on our  communities, but they are also impacting national security and economic  integrity as profits are re-invested into vast criminal networks that seek to  undermine the rule of law and destabilize our governments and economies.\nFinancial crime is also harming global economic growth. The  International Monetary Fund has found that illicit finance reduces  productivity, widens inequality, inhibits legitimate investment and hinders an  effective allocation of resources. The World Bank has found that financial crimes are a barrier to development sparking political instability, deterring  private capital, undermining good governance and the rule of law, and generally  eroding trust in governments and institutions. Illicit finance also robs treasuries of badly needed tax  revenue at a time when so many economies around the world are facing  historically high debt levels.\nThe World Bank sees tackling  illicit finance in  low-capacity countries as vital to their development priorities and requiring  sustained engagement. Strengthening AML/CFT/CPF capacity  in developing and low-capacity countries would improve financial inclusion and further deprive  international organized crime groups of opportunities to launder their illicit  proceeds or finance terrorism.\nIn this  context, technically  sound and effective AML/CFT/CPF frameworks contribute to safer communities, our  collective security, and to stronger economies in the G7 and around the globe.\nThe Way Forward\nUnder the  Canadian G7 Presidency, Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors have taken  stock of the fight we launched in 1989 and identified areas for further action.  Today, we endorse the present\nFinancial  Crime Call to Action\nto\nstrengthen global security, protect  financial sector integrity, and foster economic growth and economic\ndevelopment\n.\nStrengthening our Frameworks\nWe re-commit to the founding principles of the FATF  and will continue to actively support the organization.\nThe FATF is the ultimate AML/CFT/CPF standard setter that  catalyzes improvements in members’ AML/CFT/CPF regimes. It is essential to  maintain the FATF’s role at the centre of the global fight against illicit  finance.\nWe commit to  ensuring that the FATF remains a technical body that produces in-depth and  impartial peer reviews and research that inform our ongoing understanding of  risk.\nWe commit to improving the effectiveness of our       respective AML/CFT/CPF regimes. The G7 must lead by example.\nG7        financial systems remain the most interconnected in the world and        continue to represent attractive targets for bad actors seeking to        launder ill-gotten gains. The G7 will continue to improve our        effectiveness in preventing the proceeds of crime from entering our        financial sectors, detecting and disrupting money laundering threats,        sanctioning criminals and depriving them of their illegitimate proceeds        in a manner consistent with our domestic legal frameworks.\nShell companies are enablers for criminals to hide        proceeds of crime and engage in illicit activities, such as large-scale        tax and sanctions evasion. Ensuring that competent authorities,        particularly law enforcement, have sufficient resources and tools to        investigate and prosecute money laundering, terrorist financing, and        proliferation financing involving shell companies is critical to fighting        financial crime.\nThe procurement of dual use and military        technology through circumvention of sanctions violates United Nations        Security Council Resolutions and undermines global security. We commit to        enhancing implementation of our targeted financial sanctions and ensuring        they are the most effective in the world.\nEnhancing International Cooperation\nWe will  stay abreast of emerging risks tied to money laundering, terrorist financing  and proliferation financing through research and\nthe development of joint typologies and strategic intelligence.\nWe express our serious concerns that virtual asset  thefts and scams, including by  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, have reached unprecedented levels. These threats, as well as the methods used by criminals to  launder their proceeds, must be better understood and  addressed. This is necessary to raise awareness,  enhance prevention, and mitigate money laundering as well as being critical to promoting  responsible innovation in virtual assets and protecting virtual asset users in  our jurisdictions. We will further research and exchange information such  as typology work on emerging risks related to virtual assets, including from  the perspectives of cybersecurity and AML/CFT/CPF, and take necessary measures.\nWe recognize that illicit actors will continue to  take advantage of jurisdictional differences in approaches to countering  sanctions evasion and the financing of proliferation. Therefore, we commit to  work together to maintain an up-to-date and common understanding of relevant  threats, vulnerabilities, and typologies to prevent and combat complex  proliferation financing and sanctions evasion schemes.\nWe must break down silos and deepen the responsible  exchange of information internationally to make it harder for criminals to  access the financial system and evade detection.\nBad actors are exploiting silos within, and across,  AML/CFT/CPF regimes to conceal their actions. In response, we will improve  risk-based and secure information sharing internationally between our national  competent authorities, and domestically amongst the private sector and between  public and private sector partners, consistent with our domestic legal  frameworks. Facilitating this type of information sharing supports G7 efforts  to mitigate the negative impacts of fraud on our businesses and citizens and to  combat illicit activities by transnational organized crime groups, including  cartels.\nMany of our financial institutions operate across G7 markets. We will        encourage deeper cooperation between our regulators who supervise on a group-wide basis. We        commit to ensuring that our AML/CFT/CPF supervision is risk-based,        effective and focused on stopping financial crime. We will also ensure        that sanctions for non-compliance are proportionate, dissuasive and        effective.\nAddressing  Financial Crime as a Barrier to Growth and Stability\nWe will support efforts to  strengthen AML/CFT/CPF frameworks in lower capacity countries to foster growth and  economic development.\nThis can be achieved through many  channels, including bilateral and multilateral assistance and collaboration.  This work will ensure the G7 together with other FATF members keep pace with  evolving regional risks, and support asset recovery to further deprive  criminals of illicit proceeds and reduce opportunities for money laundering.\nThe FATF and its Global Network of nine FATF-Style  Regional Bodies (FSRBs), which bring together more than 200 jurisdictions and  20 observer international organizations, are at the heart of the global fight  against financial crime. We reiterate our commitment to supporting the FSRBs in  overseeing the consistent and effective implementation of the FATF standards  worldwide, including in the next round of mutual evaluations.\nWe commit to supporting the effective implementation  of AML/CFT/CPF measures that are risk-based and proportionate.\nWe recognize that a risk-based approach can promote economic development and financial inclusion by encouraging assessments of risk,  identifying lower and higher risk scenarios, and implementing simplified  AML/CFT/CPF measures in certain scenarios proportionate to the relevant  risks.\nBy implementing the revised FATF standards, we will  facilitate legitimate funds continuing to move through the formal financial  sector, promoting economic development and financial inclusion while mitigating unintended  consequences.\nWe commit to exploring the role of technology in  AML/CFT/CPF implementation.\nWe encourage  adoption of new technologies that can more effectively detect, report and  interdict illicit finance. This includes partnering with the private sector to understand  how emerging technologies (including artificial intelligence) can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness  of AML/CFT/CPF regimes. This should be consistent with our respective domestic  legal frameworks and risk-based, while ensuring data protection and human  rights.\nWe continue  to support the FATF’s initiatives to accelerate global implementation of its  standards on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) as well  as its work on emerging risks, including those that arise from misuse of  stablecoins and peer-to-peer transactions, offshore VASPs, and decentralized  finance (DeFi) arrangements.\nWe are  contributing to the FATF’s ongoing work to strengthen its Standards on Payment  Transparency to adapt to changes in payment  business models and messaging standards and to  foster payment systems that are more transparent, inclusive, accessible, safe  and secure, while enabling faster and cheaper transactions, including  remittances. Consistent with this work, we also support the G20 Roadmap for  Enhancing Cross-border Payments.\nLastly,  we commit to furthering this work under the French G7 Presidency in 2026, in  coordination with all FATF members, and to report on the actions taken to  implement the commitments in this Call to Action.\nWe  encourage all countries to join us in this Call to Action. The international  community can, and must, strengthen our collective response to financial crime  and its impact on communities, security, and prosperity.\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nFinance\n|\nDepartment of Finance Canada\n|\nCanada\n|\nG7\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\n|\nHon.

Food, medicines and essential supplies are exhausted. The population faces starvation. Gaza’s people must receive the aid they desperately need.\n“Prior to the aid block, the UN and humanitarian NGOs delivered aid into Gaza, working with great courage, at the risk of their lives and in the face of major access challenges imposed by Israel. These organisations subscribe to upholding humanitarian principles, operating independently, with neutrality, impartiality and humanity. They have the logistical capacity, expertise and operational coverage to deliver assistance across Gaza to those who need it most.\n“Israel’s security cabinet has reportedly approved a new model for delivering aid into Gaza, which the UN and our humanitarian partners cannot support. They are clear that they will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles. Humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world and should be applied consistently in every warzone. The UN has raised concerns that the proposed model cannot deliver aid effectively, at the speed and scale required. It places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the UN and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives. Humanitarian aid should never be politicised, and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change.\n“As humanitarian donors, we have two straightforward messages for the Government of Israel: allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately and enable the UN and humanitarian organizations to work independently and impartially to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity. We remain committed to meeting the acute needs we see in Gaza. We also reiterate our firm message that Hamas must immediately release all remaining hostages and allow humanitarian assistance to be distributed without interference. It is our firm conviction that an immediate return to a ceasefire and working towards the implementation of a two-state solution are the only way to bring peace and security to Israelis and Palestinians and ensure long-term stability for the whole region.”\nContacts\nMedia Relations Office\nGlobal Affairs Canada\nmedia@international.gc.ca\nFollow us on X (Twitter):\n@CanadaFP\nLike us on Facebook:\nCanada’s foreign policy - Global Affairs Canada\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nForeign affairs\n|\nGlobal Affairs Canada\n|\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip\n|\nAustralia\n|\nGermany\n|\nIceland\n|\nIreland\n|\nItaly\n|\nJapan\n|\nLatvia\n|\nLithuania\n|\nLuxembourg\n|\nNetherlands\n|\nNew Zealand\n|\nNorway\n|\nPortugal\n|\nSlovenia\n|\nSpain\n|\nSweden\n|\nUnited Kingdom\n|\nCanada and the world\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\n|\nHon.

We support those facing discrimination or violence solely for being themselves. No one should be denied their dignity or human rights because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.\n“This year’s theme, The Power of Communities, highlights the strength, resilience and unity of 2SLGBTQI+ communities in the ongoing struggle for equality. Across the globe, courageous NGOs, human rights defenders and advocates continue to lead efforts to protect fundamental human rights and freedoms, often at great personal risk. Canada supports and stands with these individuals and organizations, amplifying and adding to their voices and efforts for justice.\n“May 17 marks the day in 1990 when the World Health Organization declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder—a step forward in the long journey to equality. Today, we reflect on the hard-earned progress we have made. At the same time, we acknowledge the challenges that remain, at home and worldwide. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing human rights and inclusion for 2SLGBTQI+ people through international engagement.”\nContacts\nMedia Relations Office\nGlobal Affairs Canada\nmedia@international.gc.ca\nFollow us on X (Twitter):\n@CanadaFP\n,\n@CanadaDev\n,\n@CanadaTrade\nLike us on Facebook:\nCanada’s foreign policy - Global Affairs Canada\nCanada’s international development - Global Affairs Canada\nCanada’s international trade - Global Affairs Canada\nFollow us on Instagram:\n@canadadev\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nForeign affairs\n|\nGlobal Affairs Canada\n|\nCanada\n|\nCanada and the world\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\n|\nHon.

Canada continues to support efforts to ensure that justice is served and to reinforce international mechanisms that protect civilian lives.”\nContacts\nMedia Relations Office\nGlobal Affairs Canada\nmedia@international.gc.ca\nFollow us on X:\n@CanadaFP\nLike us on Facebook:\nCanada’s foreign policy - Global Affairs Canada\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nForeign affairs\n|\nGlobal Affairs Canada\n|\nCanada\n|\nRussia\n|\nAustralia\n|\nNetherlands\n|\nCanada and the world\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\n|\nHon.

The CRA has the dual responsibility of administering tax legislation and distributing benefit payments to those who need them most. I trust that he will give both aspects of this role the attention they require.\nMr. Champagne brings a wealth of experience. He has held a variety of ministerial portfolios, from Minister of Infrastructure and Communities to Minister of Foreign Affairs to Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. I am sure that his variety of expertise will be an important asset in his dual role as Minister of Finance and National Revenue.\nAs well, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Honourable Wayne Long, Secretary of State (Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Institutions). He brings an interesting perspective acquired through his active engagement with numerous parliamentary committees, notably the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. I am therefore confident he will be proactive in making sure the CRA pursue its dual role, especially for the most vulnerable among us.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to thank the Honourable Élisabeth Brière. Although I was her special advisor for only a short period of time, it was a pleasure working with her to improve the CRA’s services.\nDuring her time as Minister, our Office released two systemic examination reports—\nTiming Is Everything\n, about how the CRA administers the Canada child benefit, and\nUnintended Consequences\n, about the CRA’s administration of the bare trust filing requirements. Between these two reports, we made a total of 16 recommendations. I was pleased to see that she provided thoughtful responses for how the CRA could improve the areas we identified. I wish her the best in her work as a member of Parliament for Sherbrooke.\nI am looking forward to working with both the Minister and the Secretary of State in implementing the aforementioned recommendations made in our last two systemic reports.\nMr. François Boileau, Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson\nBackground information\nThe Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson works independently from the CRA. Canadians can submit complaints to the Office if they feel they are not receiving the appropriate service from the CRA. Our main objective is to improve the service the CRA provides to taxpayers and benefit recipients by reviewing individual service complaints and service issues that affect more than one person or a segment of the population.\nThe Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson assists, advises and informs the Minister of Finance and National Revenue about matters relating to services provided by the CRA. The Ombudsperson ensures, in particular, that the CRA respects eight of the service rights outlined in the\nTaxpayer Bill of Rights\n.\nContacts\nMedia Relations\nOffice of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson / Government of Canada\nMediaRelations-RelationsMedias@oto-boc.gc.ca\nFollow Us\nFollow us on X:\n@OTO_Canada\nLike us on Facebook:\n@TaxpayersOmbudsperson\nFollow us on\nLinkedIn\nSubscribe to our\nelectronic mailing list\nAdd our\nRSS feed\nto your feed reader\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nTaxes\n|\nMinisters\n|\nOffice of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson\n|\nCanada\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\nPage details\nDate modified:\n2025-05-14",

The announcement marked the end of the Second World War in Europe, and a decisive victory for the Allied forces.\n“For Canada, it meant the safe return of hundreds of thousands of troops that had fought so valiantly for freedom, democracy and global stability. Among them was\nChief Warrant Officer Anton “Tony” Pearson\n, who enlisted in 1943 and helped liberate the Netherlands. He was in Oldenburg, Germany, with the South Saskatchewan Regiment when the German surrender was confirmed.\n“The end of the war was a moment of triumph for Canada, Newfoundland, and their Allies, but also one of solemn reflection as the more than 45,000 Canadians and Newfoundlanders who made the ultimate sacrifice were mourned. These losses would not be in vain.\n“Canada would go on to play a key role in shaping the post-war order, becoming a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and advocating for diplomacy, international development, the protection of human rights and the prevention of future conflicts.\n“At this time of increased volatility in the world, we must never forget that the peace won in the Second World War is not self-sustaining. It requires vigilance, cooperation, and a deep commitment from likeminded allies who believe in the values of democracy, justice, and human dignity. Through organizations like the UN and NATO, Canada is committed to collective defence, international cooperation and the pursuit of a world where conflicts are resolved through diplomacy rather than war.\n“As Churchill himself declared on Victory in Europe Day, 80 years ago today: ‘Long live the cause of freedom!’\nAssociated Links:\n80\nth\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War - Veterans Affairs Canada\nContacts\nMedia Relations\nVeterans Affairs Canada\n613-992-7468\nmedia@veterans.gc.ca\nMedia Relations\nDepartment of National Defence\nPhone: 613-904-3333\nmlo-blm@forces.gc.ca\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nVeterans\n|\nVeterans Affairs Canada\n|\nNational Defence\n|\nCanada\n|\nMilitary history and heritage\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nmedia\n|\nstatements\nPage details\nDate modified:\n2025-05-08",

We recognize the strength and courage of families, survivors, and communities who continue to advocate for the dignity and justice of their loved ones.\nAlso known as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQI+ People, Red Dress Day was first commemorated in 2010 and was inspired by Métis artist Jaime Black-Morsette’s REDress Project—an art installation featuring red dresses hung in public spaces as a visual reminder of the number of Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and 2SLGBTQI+ people who are missing or have been murdered in Canada.\nViolence continues to disproportionately impact Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people. This day raises awareness of this national crisis and offers us the opportunity to reflect on the efforts made—and the work still left to be done to address the deep-rooted, systemic issues and help build a safer and more equitable society. The Government of Canada’s efforts to tackle root causes are guided by the\nNational Action Plan\n, the\nFederal Pathway to Address Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People\n, which is\nreported on annually\n, and the\nNational Inquiry’s Calls for Justice\n.\nExamples of these efforts over the past year include initiatives like the\nthird annual National Indigenous-Federal-Provincial-Territorial Meeting on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTIQ+ People\n, the first-ever\nRed Dress Alert pilot in Manitoba\nand projects such as the\nInuvialuit Family Wellness Centre\nand the\nIndigenous Victim and Family Liaison Program\n. By partnering with Indigenous survivors, families, leaders, and organizations, as well as with provinces and territories, we are addressing the long-standing and emerging issues related to this national crisis.\nToday we honour the lives lost, recognize the strength of families and communities, and recommit to building a future where all Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people can live in safety and security, free from fear.”\nContacts\nFor more information, media may contact:\nKyle Leonard\nDirector of Communications and Issues Management\nOffice of the Honourable Gary Anandasangaree\nMinister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs\nkyle.leonard@rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca\nMedia Relations\nCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada\nRCAANC.media.CIRNAC@sac-isc.gc.ca\nJennifer Kozelj\nPress Secretary\nOffice of the Honourable Patty Hajdu\nMinister of Indigenous Services\njennifer.kozelj@sac-isc.gc.ca\nMedia Relations\nIndigenous Services Canada\nmedia@sac-isc.gc.ca\nMedia Relations\nWomen and Gender Equality Canada\nmedia@fegc-wage.gc.ca\n819-420-6530\nStay connected\nJoin the conversation about Indigenous Peoples in Canada:\nX:\n@GCIndigenous\n@GovCanNorth\nFacebook:\n@GCIndigenous\n@GovCanNorth\nInstagram:\n@gcindigenous\n@govcannorth\nYou can subscribe to receive our news releases and speeches via RSS feeds.

Please take a moment to reflect and offer our gratitude to the Indigenous Nations and communities who are the traditional caretakers of these lands and waters.\nAs mentioned, I am Pierre Tremblay, President of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, or CNSC, and I couldn’t be happier to be speaking to you today on behalf of the regulator.\nMy 40 years in Canada’s nuclear sector have been very rewarding. My career has given me a deep appreciation and respect for the people who work in the sector and their shared focus on safety and the culture that supports it.\nFor my remarks this morning, I will share my perspective on the nuclear landscape here in Canada – both our focused oversight of the existing fleet and our readiness to regulate new nuclear.\nI also want to provide updates on how the CNSC is working to become more efficient in delivering its priorities. And finally, I will offer my thoughts on furthering our own engagement efforts and strengthening trust with all people in Canada – as well as our expectations of industry and proponents.\nNuclear in Canada\nThis is an important and interesting time for Canada’s nuclear sector – we must step up and face the moment.\nWe recognize the sector will continue to evolve and we will continue to be ready to regulate and respond to advancements without compromising safety.\nAs the regulator, we are expected to continue our efforts to manage regulatory burden, expedite reviews and maintain a competent and talented workforce, innovating and leveraging new techniques, approaches and technologies to find even greater efficiencies.\nAs we do all of this, we will never compromise on safety. The industry must do the same. Together, we can all ensure the deployment of safe nuclear projects.\nWhile Canada’s nuclear sector is complex and changing, the continued safe operations of the existing fleet is paramount and fulfilling our mandate and delivering on our important job here at home remains my top priority.\nWe also need to continue to ensure readiness to regulate new technologies and approaches. The CNSC is committed to reviewing and regulating safe nuclear projects in Canada, including new reactors, large and small.\nThat is why we value our strong relationships with international partners such as the US NRC and the United Kingdom’s ONR.\nAnd why we are heartened to know they are equally committed and value our ongoing collaboration.\nThere is a drive to build new nuclear and expand infrastructure in support of the growing electricity market; this includes, for example, the appropriate extraction of minerals.\nLuckily, the CNSC as a life cycle regulator is an extremely capable organization. But the responsibility does not sit with us alone. We need others to engage meaningfully. Only then will the sector move forward.\nNew nuclear\nFrom my perspective at the regulator, Canada’s nuclear sector continues to be one of this country’s strengths. The mechanisms and tools are in place. But there is a need to embrace the moment.\nNow, what do I mean by this?\nMore provinces are now looking at carbon-free technologies. Nuclear is naturally seeing more interest.\nThis includes the potential for new units in Ontario and New Brunswick. We are also seeing the sector expand to include new provinces and sites in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nOn April 4, the Commission issued a Nuclear Power Reactor Construction licence to Ontario Power Generation to construct 1 General Electric Hitachi BWRX-300 reactor at its Darlington New Nuclear Project site in Clarington, Ontario.\nThis is the first power reactor licence to construct that the CNSC has issued in its 25 years. And actually, the first power reactor licence to construct in Canada in over 50 years.\nThe CNSC will continue to work with all provincial partners to ensure regulatory clarity and efficiency.\nWith this evolution in the sector, the concept of the traditional nuclear host community in Canada is evolving along with the technology. This requires a change in how the CNSC informs and engages with all people in Canada, a need to continue to modernize our regulatory framework, and a willingness to evolve together.\nThe CNSC at its core\nThis gets to the heart of the CNSC – how we operate, what our priorities and focus are. All of these considerations are essential to the nuclear sector in Canada.\nThe CNSC is a globally recognized, mature nuclear regulator, with all the governance needed to provide strong regulatory oversight.\nWhether this is working alone or in collaboration the CNSC is willing to evolve and work to improve the regulatory framework and identify efficiencies.\nCollaboration and regulatory efficiency\nWe are open to recognizing and altering how we achieve our goal to ensure the safety of all people in Canada.\nWhile we will never reduce our high standards for safety and security that we have established, we recognize there may be different ways to get the same result. And this is where we remain open.\nIt is not for me or the CNSC to tell industry how to pivot, but as technology continues to evolve and the sector continues to modernize, there are opportunities to revisit how we work together.\nRemote monitoring and access to data is something industry is – and should be – considering. Remote access supports efficiency, as the regulator can access more real-time information.\nThe CNSC will evolve along with the sector. We welcome the suggestions and will engage in a meaningful way to identify improvements.\nBut improvement begins at home, and the review of the CNSC’s regulatory framework identified an opportunity to ensure clarity of requirements for SMRs, such as ensuring we are using a technology-neutral, risk-informed, performance-based approach.\nWe recognize and are committed to ensuring that our regulations are risk-informed and set out clear performance objectives.\nFor example, exploring amendments to the Nuclear Security Regulations that respond to changes in security threats and adapt to technological advancements.\nThe CNSC as a lifecycle regulator is committed to delivering effective and timely regulatory decisions for nuclear projects.\nSMRs and other advances in technology continue to afford us the ability to identify challenges and turn them into opportunities to modernize and evolve.\nCNSC readiness\nI have already mentioned that we are refocusing our energies here at home – there is a need to focus on mission critical and safety significant issues in our existing nuclear fleet, and to be efficient and timely in our work.\nThis of course must be balanced with a readiness for new technologies, techniques and activities – all of which require us to conduct meaningful engagement and consultation with the Indigenous Nations and communities whose rights and interests may be impacted by nuclear activities.\nDelivering on this considerable agenda means that talent management is vital to ensure that we have the capacity to support our work.\nThis capacity comes from a diverse workforce. We know from experience that our workplace is stronger, better and more capable when it is diverse. We remain unabashedly committed to diversity in the workplace.\nThat is why the CNSC continues to focus efforts on supporting diversity across the nuclear sector. 2025 will see our third Indigenous Girls in STEM workshop, which provides Indigenous girls an inclusive space to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM subjects. The workshop enables them to do so in a way that weaves together learning with Indigenous culture, knowledge and traditions.\nDiverse voices are vital to fostering innovation and lead to better decision-making and better safety outcomes. Complex challenges like those we face in the nuclear sector require varied perspectives.\nThe path to positive results\nI will now offer my thoughts on how we further our engagement efforts and strengthen trust with all people in Canada – this, I believe, is the recipe for success.\nWe are committed to continuing our collaboration, engagement and consultation with Indigenous Nations and communities in support of advancing reconciliation. The CNSC is also committed to engaging with the public and interested parties as part of improving our regulatory processes.\nWe remain flexible and open minded around how we execute our mandate and our requirements. This will enable us to find new ways of working that serve all involved – and we will never compromise on safety.\nBarriers need to be removed, support and capacity provided and a commitment to meaningful engagement. All of this will allow us to address the key challenges to meaningful engagement, finding tangible solutions to enable an effective path forward for advancing reconciliation.\nMeaningful engagement and inclusion of Indigenous peoples in relation to the nuclear sector is something that the whole of Government and the nuclear sector must be committed to and actively support.\nThere are a number of examples across the nuclear sector where we have seen some promising relationship-building and partnerships.\nOne such example is the Neya Wabun Guardian Program established through the long-term relationship agreement between the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation or AOPFN, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, AECL and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, CNL.\nThis program establishes an AOPFN monitoring presence at Chalk River Laboratories, enabling reporting back to their leadership. The environmental monitoring program weaves together science with Indigenous Knowledge and values which is an important step towards reconciliation.\nAOPFN have been willing to engage meaningfully and are working hard to the benefit of their nation and community.\nThe equity partnership between the Saugeen Ojibway Nation or SON and Bruce Power supports the global fight against cancer and provides new economic opportunities within SON Territory, including an equity stake and a revenue-sharing program benefiting the community directly.\nIt is important to highlight these partnerships that provide many groups – Indigenous Nations and communities, environmentalists, community members – with access and opportunities to participate.\nAt the CNSC we have made material changes to demonstrate that we are listening and responding to the interests and concerns of rights holders.\nFor example, during our part two hearing for OPG’s application for a licence to construct an SMR at the Darlington site – the Darlington New Nuclear Project, we listened, heard and learned, which led to important and impactful changes to this proceeding that demonstrated inclusivity and recognition of the rights holders.\nWe changed the physical layout of the room by removing the standard stage under the Commission, so we were all on the same level. The Commission also benefitted from the time that was dedicated for Indigenous ceremony, song and prayer.\nThese efforts enhanced the experience of all hearing participants, resulting in a more inclusive and collaborative environment, which in turn serves to continuously strengthen trust.\nThe Commission has also revised its practices, addressing feedback from rights holders and providing more time to ensure the perspectives of rights holders are heard.\nIt is also focused on transparency in its hearing process. Understanding that the public is entitled to hearing information and documentation and that such transparency serves to build and maintain trust in the regulatory process.\nWe must do more. And we are committed to doing more.\nThe CNSC remains committed to consultation, engagement and collaboration with Indigenous Nations and communities.\nThis is consistent with the\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act\nor “UNDA”, which was passed by Canadian Parliament in 2021.\nUNDA requires the development and implementation of an action plan in consultation and collaboration with Indigenous peoples. It also requires we ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with the UN Declaration.\nIn addition to supporting the Action Plan efforts, the CNSC actively works to establish long-term relationships with Indigenous Nations, supporting capacity building, enabling studies and data gathering through our funding programs, and collaborating on monitoring and oversight activities, joint assessments and reporting to the Commission.\nRecently, the Federal Court of Canada issued its decision on the Judicial Review application brought by Kebaowek First Nation, KFN, challenging the Commission’s authorization to CNL to construct a Near Surface Disposal Facility.\nThis decision recognizes the CNSC’s “broad, inclusive approach to consultation” and finds that the Commission’s decision concerning the impacts of the proposed NSDF is reasonable. The Court also directed CNL and the CNSC to resume consultation with KFN with a view to implementing the UNDRIP free, prior and informed consent standard\nThere is a need for us to better understand from the perspective of Indigenous Nations and communities what free, prior and informed consent means to them. We need to better understand these perspectives so that we can work together to move forward.\nAll of this is an example of how we are evolving to address the ever-changing landscape.\nIn short, we’re doing our part and expect industry to do the same.\nConclusion\nWe are at a critical juncture in history. And we have lots to do.\nThe CNSC will be here making sure that safety remains top of mind for everyone.\nAnd we will continue to work hard to provide clarity on our expectations and requirements. In return, we expect everyone else to engage and to deliver as well.\nThank you.\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nNuclear energy\n|\nNuclear facilities\n|\nNuclear power plants\n|\nNuclear technology\n|\nCanadian Nuclear Safety Commission\n|\nCanada\n|\nEnergy\n|\nNuclear, oil and gas, and mining regulation\n|\nAboriginal peoples\n|\nbusiness\n|\ngeneral public\n|\ngovernment\n|\nspeeches\nPage details\nDate modified:\n2025-05-05",

        "full_text_scraped": "Claire Anderson to the British Columbia Broadband Association\nFrom:\nCanadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission\nSpeech\nWith that out of the way, I would like to get to the things we can discuss, especially considering the theme of this year’s conference: “The Dollars and Sense of Telecom.” Because for many of the members here today, the CRTC’s recent regulatory decisions create the potential to open up new market opportunities for service providers willing to seize them.\nRichmond, British Columbia\nApril 22, 2025\nClaire Anderson, Commissioner for British Columbia and the Yukon\nCanadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)\nCheck against delivery\nThank you once again, Bob, for that welcome and for inviting me to join all of you once again at the British Columbia Broadband Association’s annual conference. My thanks, as well, to the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations for allowing us to conduct our conference on their traditional, ancestral and unceded territories.\nThe City of Vancouver acknowledges that the City is “located on territory that was never ceded, or given up to the Crown by the Musqueam, Squamish, or Tsleil-Waututh peoples. The term unceded acknowledges the dispossession of the land and the inherent rights of those Indigenous peoples to the territory.” So again, I pay my respects.\nThank for you for inviting me to speak with you for a third year running now. This time, of course, I am meeting with you under very different circumstances, as we are currently in the midst of an election period.\nAs you know, the CRTC is an independent quasi-judicial tribunal that regulates the Canadian communications sector in the public interest. We hold public consultations on telecommunications and broadcasting matters and make decisions based on the public record.\nAnd as an independent tribunal, we are mindful that during an election period the federal public service operates under the principles outlined in what is commonly referred to as the “caretaker convention.” We, like the rest of the government, continue routine operations and necessary business, but we exercise restraint in what we say and do to demonstrate respect for the democratic process.\nWhat that means for today is I will not be able to discuss, for the most part, what the future might hold for the CRTC. I certainly will not speculate on the election or what it might mean for the CRTC, your sector, or any other areas of interest being discussed at the conference today. This will be true both for my time here at the podium, as well as in any discussion we have together afterward.\nWith that out of the way, I would like to get to the things we\ncan\ndiscuss, especially considering the theme of this year’s conference: “The Dollars and Sense of Telecom.” Because for many of the members here today, the CRTC’s recent regulatory decisions create the potential to open up new market opportunities for service providers willing to seize them.\nSo let’s get started.\nHSA\nI am, of course, referring to our decisions over the past couple years regarding aggregated, wholesale high-speed access services over fibre-to-the-home networks. The process by which we arrived at our decision began when we received a new policy direction from the government in February 2023. The direction asked us to renew our approach to telecommunications policy in Canada, requiring the CRTC to consider how our decisions could promote competition, affordability, reliability, and consumer interests.\nShortly after we launched a proceeding on the Internet services market, focusing on how we could increase competition and encourage more affordable choices for consumers in the market.\nIn November of the same year, we released an interim decision that provided competitors with a workable way to sell Internet services using the fibre-to-the-home networks of large telephone companies in Ontario and Quebec, where the CRTC had noticed that competition in the market had declined most significantly.\nWe continued our public process, including a comprehensive review of all submissions on the matter, as well as a week-long public hearing in February of last year. In August 2024, we released our final decision in the proceeding. That decision expands competitor access to fibre networks nationwide.\nOur decisions throughout this process have aimed to promote greater competition in the Internet services marketplace while ensuring incentives for companies to continue investing in high-quality networks. For example, the access granted in our decisions only includes fibre that was already deployed on the date of the decision. Any new fibre built after that date is exempt until August 2029.\nOur hope is that through this decision, British Columbians and Canadians in general will soon benefit from increased competition for high-speed Internet. Because we know increased competition leads to more affordable choices and innovative services.\nFor service providers like many of you here today, the new framework presents an opportunity to compete in the fibre-to-home market. The access to that market is already available – large telephone companies had to be ready to grant it to competitors by February 2025. So we hope that you consider this as an option in your business planning.\nBroadband Fund\nPromoting both competition and continued investment has been one key focus of CRTC decisions in the past couple years. Another area where we have focused much of our attention is on expanding networks to ensure all Canadians have access to high-quality and reliable Internet – especially in underserved rural, remote, and Indigenous communities. The open data we publish tells us that 21.8 percent of households in those areas do not have access to reliable 50/10 connectivity.\nIn 2016, we decided to overhaul our program for ensuring basic telephone service to all Canadians to focus on broadband. We established the criteria for the Broadband Fund in 2018, and launched three calls for applications – the first two in 2019, and then the third in 2022.\nWe have directed funding to Inuit communities in northern Quebec and Nunavut, to nearly 100 kilometres of major roads in Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec and Ontario, and to roads and rural communities in the Yukon, here in B.C., and in Manitoba. Over the Fund’s lifetime, it has supported improved broadband infrastructure for more than 270 communities, including significant investments in the Far North.\nThirty-one of these projects are in the $1 to $10 million range. Seventeen of these projects come in at $1 million or below. Although we are encouraged to see that smaller providers have been able to successfully apply for funding, we know that we can do more to make it easier.\nThat’s why we are conducting an ongoing review of the Fund. Late last year we announced a number of changes in three broad areas — making it faster for you to submit an application and for us to evaluate it; supporting Indigenous applicants; and making our mapping more sensible and accessible.\nIn terms of faster application and evaluation, we simplified some eligibility and assessment criteria, like the requirement to propose specific packages and rates. We also collapsed the separate access and transport categories to further simplify things. We have reduced the amount of information required at all stages of the funding process, and we’ve consolidated separate reporting requirements.\nIn terms of reducing barriers for Indigenous applicants, we have made a number of changes including on community engagement. We have taken steps to streamline the application process and to provide Indigenous applicants with a dedicated point of contact in our Indigenous Relations Team, instead of having to navigate our processes alone.\nWe are also providing funding for up to two years of technical training for Indigenous staff in communities they are proposing to serve as part of funded capital projects, and for Indigenous applicants we are not requiring a 10% holdback on projects with approved funding of $5 million or less. Furthermore, we are requiring each Broadband Fund applicant to obtain and show they have conducted meaningful consultations with Indigenous communities and earned consent for any projects that are built on their territories.\nFinally, in terms of updating our mapping, we’ve dropped the hexagons for a call-by-call approach, expanded how we define major transportation roads, and provided a way to identify the roads that provide key linkages between communities.\nWe expect these changes to improve how we operate the Fund and improve outcomes for recipients. Any further changes we make will be in service of our overarching goal: to help close the remaining connectivity gaps across the country effectively and efficiently.\nRecent decisions and ongoing consultations\nOur Broadband Fund work and our decisions regarding network access are not our only ongoing telecommunications work at the CRTC. Far from it.\nJust two months ago at the end of February we also released a decision to help strengthen network resiliency and reliability for emergency services like 9-1-1. Measures in the decision will help improve the resiliency of the wireless public alerting system, prioritize 9-1-1 traffic over Internet traffic during periods of network congestion, and provide greater information to the public on how to contact emergency services during outages.\nAs British Columbians know all too well, access to emergency services and public alerts are even more important in a crisis. We will continue to help support Canadians’ access to 9-1-1 services and public alerts within our mandate.\nAnother of our ongoing work streams at the CRTC regards access to poles and support structures. As many of you know, we issued decisions in recent years streamlining the approach to accessing support structures that are owned or controlled by large incumbent local exchange carriers, and then finalizing the tariffs by which to do so.\nAt the same time, we have been exploring whether these tariffs ought to give competitors the right to include wireless attachments to help deploy next-generation 5G networks — in other words, whether the rules requiring telcos to let third parties attach equipment to support structures should be modified and, potentially, broadened. What types of facilities could be deployed to support wireless networks? What would that mean for spare capacity, construction standards, and interference? What can we do at the Commission to streamline processes?\nThese are just a few of the questions we are considering. Because this is a matter before us, I cannot even hint at any possible outcome, except that any decision we make will continue to promote both greater competition and more investment in networks.\nNext, I want to take a few moments to explain some of our ongoing work on the consumer side of things. While we hope our high-speed access to fibre-to-the-home networks decision will improve choice and affordability for consumers, we also think more can be done to ensure consumers have better information in the Internet services market.\nLast fall, we published our\nConsumer Protections Action Plan\n, which summarizes our measures to ensure clear contracts and promote transparency both in terms of how consumers are able to choose their provider, and in knowing what to expect from them.\nWe are currently engaged in a series of four consultations around making it easier to choose, change, and cancel a plan.\nThe first one is about clear rules for notifying customers when their plans or discounts are about to end. The second looks at fees that some service providers may charge when a subscriber cancels or changes a plan. The third consultation is around tools that providers give their subscribers to manage their plans, like online portals.\nAnd the fourth is about whether service providers should have to provide information in a standardized way to make it easier for Canadians to compare plans. To take a well-known example — we are all used to seeing nutrition labels when we visit the grocery store. We are considering a common look and feel for information on broadband services, so that it can be conveyed in a consistent manner from one provider to the next, just like the labels on your cereal boxes and granola bars.\nThese consultations are still very much ongoing, and there will be a public hearing on the potential labeling system in June.\nConclusion\nWhich, I think, is a good place for me to wrap up today. As I said at the beginning, at the CRTC we regulate the Canadian communications sector in the public interest.

        "full_text_scraped": "Transnational Repression Operation\nFrom:\nPrivy Council Office\nBackgrounder\nAs part of its mandate to monitor the digital information ecosystem during the general election, the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (SITE) Task Force has observed a transnational repression (TNR) operation targeting the 45th general election.\nAs part of its mandate to monitor the digital information ecosystem during the general election, the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (SITE) Task Force has observed a transnational repression (TNR) operation targeting the 45th general election.\nAs part of its mandate to monitor the digital information ecosystem during the general election, the\nSecurity and Intelligence Threats to Elections (SITE) Task Force\nhas observed a transnational repression (TNR) operation targeting the\n45\nth\ngeneral election.\nBackground\nIn December 2024, Hong Kong Police announced they would provide monetary rewards for information that would lead to the arrest of six individuals living overseas, including two Canadians.\nThe decision by Hong Kong to issue international bounties and cancel the passports of democracy activists and former Hong Kong lawmakers, is deplorable. This attempt by Hong Kong authorities to conduct\nTNR\nabroad, including by issuing threats, intimidation or coercion against Canadians or those in Canada, will not be tolerated.\nOne of the six individuals targeted by Hong Kong is Joe Tay, Conservative Party candidate for Don Valley North, and known for his opposition to\nPRC\nlaws and practices in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\nThe People’s Republic of China (PRC), including Mainland China and Hong Kong, uses a variety of tactics to carry out\nTNR\nactivities. It exploits\nPRC\n-based family members to pressure those in Canada to cease certain activities the PRC views as hostile, or to return to the\nPRC\n. It also threatens\nPRC\n-based family members with a range of potential coercive actions, including detention or financial penalties. The\nPRC\nalso leverages overseas actors to monitor, surveil and report on others in Canada.\nTo support its\nTNR\nactivities, the\nPRC\nuses its diplomatic missions,\nPRC\n-linked organizations affiliated with the United Front Work Department, community organizations and influential community leaders, among others.\nAbout transnational repression\nTransnational Repression (TNR) takes place when foreign governments reach beyond their state borders to advance their interests or silence criticism and dissent using intimidation, threats or violence, often against diaspora and exile communities.\nTNR\nactivities typically target political dissidents, human rights and democracy defenders, and religious and ethnic minority groups. But\nTNR\nalso increasingly targets the people and organizations that defend the victims. This can include activists, international students and scholars, lawyers and doctors, as well as journalists.\nHostile state actors will use a variety of tactics to extend their reach into Canada:\nPhysical intimidation and violence\n:\nMonitoring and surveillance, vandalism, threats, abduction, assault, or attempted murder. Actors can use coercion or assault as punishment or to influence opinion, and hostile state actors sometimes hire organized crime groups or proxies for this.\nThreats against overseas relatives and other connections:\nThreats against relatives and partners in the home country, to relay messages or force an action in Canada. This creates a sense of vulnerability, as close relations abroad may be victim to the laws and regulations of a non-democratic country.\nLegal manipulation\n:\nForeign states abusing legal mechanisms for coercive purposes, like libel suits, extraditions agreements, bounties for information on individuals, Interpol Red Notices, imposing sanctions, and refusing visa applications for personal or professional travel.\nCommunity ostracism\n:\nRejection from community associations, use of labels such as ‘extremist’ or ‘traitor’, or loss of access to social events and employment opportunities.\nMalicious Digital Activity\n:\nHacking, cyberbullying, targeted deepfakes, online defamation and disinformation, doxxing, or threatening online messages.\nImpact\nTNR\ncauses harm both to the victims and the community.\nAt the individual level, there is a profound psychological impact on victims who experience\nTNR\n. They might experience fear, anxiety, and stress due to the continuous surveillance and harassment they face. In fact, just knowing that a foreign government can monitor their activities or harm their families can lead many victims of\nTNR\nto self-censor or withdraw from public life.\nAt the community level,\nTNR\ncreates mistrust and division. Targeted communities may become fragmented as individuals fear infiltration by foreign agents or retaliation for associating with activists.\nTransnational Repression Operation\nDuring the writ period,\nSITE\nhas observed two significant trends related to\nMr\n. Tay across multiple social media platforms.\nInauthentic and coordinated\namplification of content\nrelated to the bounty and arrest warrant against Mr. Tay, as well as content related to his competence for political office.\nThe\nSITE\nTask Force has seen that multiple accounts or platforms published or interacted with content at similar times and dates – sometimes within minutes or even seconds of each other. This creates an increased volume of content, making it more likely that users of these platforms are exposed to the amplified narratives.\nDeliberate\nsuppression of search results\n,\nor “keyword filtering”\ncensoring\nMr\n. Tay’s name in simplified and traditional Chinese on platforms based in the\nPRC\n.\nThe\nSITE\nTask Force is observing deliberate efforts to suppress any new content about\nMr\n. Tay, and when users search his name, the search engine only returns information about the bounty.\nThis is not about a single incident with high levels of engagement. It is a series of deliberate and persistent activity across multiple platforms – those in which Chinese-speaking users in Canada are active, including: Facebook, WeChat, TikTok, RedNote, and Douyin, a sister-app of TikTok for the Chinese market.\nOverall engagement levels since December 2024 have been low, with an increase at various points during the writ period. The combined instances, inauthentic and coordinated amplification across multiple platforms, and the concerning trend of deliberate search suppression on platforms frequented by Canadians, have led us to determine that voters need to be aware.\nIt is clear that this was a deliberate attempt to amplify inauthentic content. However, at least until this point, that content has not generated much traction.\nReporting transnational repression\nIf you are in immediate danger, always call 9-1-1.\nTake a record of events:\nAs soon as it is safe, write down or record the situation as precisely as possible. Include descriptive details about the person, date and time, location, other witnesses, and event. For instance: Did it happen in-person? Was it a phone call? An email? Any security cameras or witnesses nearby?\nReport it:\nContact your local police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) or the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Clearly articulate why you believe you are being targeted and mention that you believe this is transnational repression.\nEven if the piece of information provided may not on its own be something that meets a criminal threshold, it may be a building block that helps police to identify threats, support a larger police response, or even contribute to another ongoing investigation.\nWhen the matter concerns your vote, you can also reach out to the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, and the\nSITE\nTask Force.\nContacts\nRCMP\nsecure website\nRCMP\nphone: 1-800-420-5805\nCSIS\nsecure website\nCSIS\nphone: 1-800-267-7685\nCommissioner of Canada Elections\nsecure webform\nCommissioner of Canada Elections phone: 1-855-759-6740\nSITE\nTask Force:\nSITE-MSRE@smtp.gc.ca\nSample images\nThese are just some examples among many. It is  important for the SITE Task Force to avoid amplifying this type of  transnational repression campaign any further.\nImage caption 1: Facebook post from Today Review that amplified “wanted posters” issued by the Hong Kong police for the six individuals living in Canada and the UK, including Victor Ho and Joe Tay. The post appeared in Written Cantonese on December 24th, 2024, the same day the arrest warrants were issued. The words in the image read: “Hong Kong’s National Security Department strikes again! Six individuals are wanted overseas, including Chung Kim-wah, and Joe Tay. Protecting national security never rests!”\nImage caption 2: A Facebook post that looked to denigrate Joe Tay’s candidacy for the Don Valley North riding. Posts like this one above appeared en masse on March 24 and 25th and appear to be timed for the CPC’s announcement that Tay would run in Don Valley North. The post image reads: “Wanted for national security reasons, Joe Tay, looks to run for a seat in the Canadian parliament; a successful bid would be a disaster. Is Canada about to become a fugitive’s paradise?”\nOther  languages\nChinese  (Traditional) - 中文 (繁體)\nChinese  (Simplified) - 中文 (简体)\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nGovernment and Politics\n|\nPrivy Council Office\n|\nCanada\n|\nHow government works\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nbackgrounders\nPage details\nDate modified:\n2025-04-21",

These regulations apply to a broad range of food products, including fortified foods like the food spread, Vegemite.\nIt is our inspectors' job to uphold these regulations, which are in place to protect consumers.\nRecently, the CFIA conducted a planned inspection of a licensed importer to verify compliance with Canadian regulations. During the course of this inspection, it was found that the Vegemite product being sold did not comply with Canadian regulations around vitamin fortification as well as the requirements for information on consumer prepackaged food to be in both official languages. As a result, the importer was informed of the non-compliance and voluntarily removed the product from its menu and retail offerings.\nSince then, the CFIA has requested a health risk assessment from Health Canada. This science-based assessment has determined that the level of risk to human health from the added vitamins present in the product is low when consumed in suggested serving sizes. As such, the CFIA will work with the importer to allow the product to be sold in the short-term, including revised labelling, while we collaborate with Health Canada, the manufacturer, and the importer, to find a longer-term plan for Vegemite sales across Canada.\nThe Government of Canada remains committed to food safety while supporting fair and reasonable access to culturally significant products.\nContacts\nMedia Relations\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency\n613-773-6600\ncfia.media.acia@inspection.gc.ca\nFollow us on social media\nFacebook:\nCFIACanada\nX:\n@InspectionCan\nYouTube:\n@CFIA\nInstagram:\n@CFIA_Canada\nLinkedIn:\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency\nSearch for related information by keyword:\nAgri-food products\n|\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency\n|\nCanada\n|\nFood and nutrition\n|\nbusiness\n|\nconsumers\n|\ngeneral public\n|\nstatements\nPage details\nDate modified:\n2025-04-19",
