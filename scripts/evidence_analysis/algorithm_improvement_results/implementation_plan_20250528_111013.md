## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Algorithm Performance [High Priority]

**Recommendation:** Implement enhanced keyword extraction with domain-specific terms

**Expected Impact:** Average similarity improvement: +0.0402

**Implementation:** Replace current keyword extraction with _extract_enhanced_keywords method

### 2. High-Quality Links [High Priority]

**Recommendation:** Deploy improved similarity calculation with multiple metrics

**Expected Impact:** High-potential pairs increase: +162

**Implementation:** Replace Jaccard similarity with _calculate_enhanced_similarity method

### 3. Department Alignment [Critical Priority]

**Recommendation:** Implement department standardization and mapping system

**Expected Impact:** Enable department-based filtering and boost matching accuracy

**Implementation:** Deploy department_mappings and _standardize_department methods

### 4. Content Processing [Medium Priority]

**Recommendation:** Expand content field usage for both promises and evidence

**Expected Impact:** Increase keyword coverage and matching opportunities

**Implementation:** Use all available text fields instead of limiting to primary fields

### 5. LLM Integration [Medium Priority]

**Recommendation:** Focus LLM evaluation on improved algorithm candidates

**Expected Impact:** Reduce LLM calls while focusing on 10 high-potential pairs

**Implementation:** Use improved algorithm for prefiltering before LLM evaluation

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1:** Implement enhanced keyword extraction methods
2. **Phase 2:** Deploy department standardization system
3. **Phase 3:** Integrate improved similarity calculation
4. **Phase 4:** Test with larger dataset and validate results
5. **Phase 5:** Deploy to production with monitoring
