### Current Data Matching Results


### Field Comparison Analysis


### Linking Algorithm Test Results


## Key Issues Identified

### Critical Problems
1. Only 0/10 complete matches found - data structure may have changed significantly
2. No current data has links despite backup having links - linking system is not populating link fields


### Specific Issues Found

#### Link Field Population
- **Current promises with linked_evidence_ids**: 0 / 0
- **Current evidence with promise_ids**: 0 / 0

#### Algorithm Compatibility
- **Items that would pass prefiltering**: 0 / 0
- **Department matches**: 0 / 0
- **Session matches**: 0 / 0

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Link Field Population**: Check if linking scripts are actually writing to linked_evidence_ids and promise_ids fields
2. **Test Specific Cases**: Use the complete matches found to test linking algorithms
3. **Check Data Migration**: Verify if link fields were preserved during data migration

### Algorithm Adjustments
1. **Lower Thresholds**: Consider reducing similarity thresholds if too few items pass prefiltering
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Verify that keywords are being extracted properly in current data
3. **Department Matching**: Review department matching logic for current data structure

### Testing Protocol
1. **Manual Link Creation**: Manually create a few test links to verify the system works
2. **Algorithm Testing**: Run linking algorithms on the complete matches found
3. **Validation**: Compare results with backup data expectations
