The platform highlights the need for smart grids, which utilize digital technology to optimize energy use, and enhanced grid integration through new interties to facilitate the efficient flow of clean electricity across provinces. This Council is intended to address the current fragmented approach to grid development, fostering collaboration among provinces, territories, Indigenous partners, utilities, and industry to accelerate technology adoption and ensure a reliable, clean, and interconnected electricity system for Canada's future.",
