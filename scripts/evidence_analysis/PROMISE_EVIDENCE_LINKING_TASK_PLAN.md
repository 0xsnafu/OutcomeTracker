# Promise-Evidence Linking System: Comprehensive Analysis & Improvement Task Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic approach to analyze, verify, and improve the promise-evidence linking system in the Promise Tracker application. The plan addresses data integrity, frontend functionality, linking quality, and admin interface capabilities through four interconnected tasks.

## Current System Architecture Overview

### Data Structure
- **Promises Collection**: Uses `linked_evidence_ids` array field pointing to evidence items
- **Evidence Items Collection**: Uses `promise_ids` array field for bidirectional linking
- **Promise Evidence Links Collection**: Admin review queue for pending links
- **Multiple Linking Approaches**: Legacy (`linked_evidence_ids`), current (`promise_ids`), and admin review systems

### Frontend Components
- **PromiseCard.tsx**: Shows evidence count and last update date using `promise.evidence` array
- **PromiseModal.tsx**: Loads evidence either pre-loaded via `promise.evidence` or dynamically via API using `linked_evidence_ids`
- **PromiseProgressTimeline.tsx**: Displays chronological evidence timeline with mandate commitments and evidence items

### Linking System
- **consolidated_evidence_linking.py**: Main LLM-powered linking pipeline using Langchain framework
- **Keyword Similarity Prefiltering**: Uses Jaccard similarity and common keyword counts
- **LLM Evaluation**: Gemini-powered assessment with confidence scores
- **Direct Linking**: Creates immediate links between evidence and promises
- **Admin Review Queue**: Alternative path for manual review of potential links
