      "background_and_context": "The commitment to establish a NATO Centre of Excellence on Climate and Security was introduced in the 2021 Liberal platform. It arose from a recognition that climate change is an increasingly significant threat to global security and stability, potentially leading to natural disasters, mass displacement, and resource conflicts. The Liberal government aimed to position Canada as a leading partner within NATO, contributing robustly and effectively to global security. By hosting such a centre, Canada sought to bring together diverse expertise to research and develop strategies addressing these complex security implications, reinforcing its commitment to both climate action and allied defence.",

      "description": "This commitment aims to extend access to the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre (SMRC), a body providing independent support for those affected by sexual misconduct, to include all Department of National Defence employees, Veterans, and military families, beyond just Canadian Armed Forces members.",
      "background_and_context": "This commitment stems from ongoing efforts to address sexual assault and harassment within the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and the broader Defence Team. The Liberal government previously established the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre (SMRC) to offer independent support to CAF members. However, recognition grew that sexual misconduct impacts a wider community, including Department of National Defence employees, Veterans, and military families. The promise in the 2021 platform aimed to expand SMRC access, ensuring that everyone associated with Canada's defence apparatus has the right to a safe workplace and access to support, reflecting a broader societal need to combat harassment and discrimination.",
