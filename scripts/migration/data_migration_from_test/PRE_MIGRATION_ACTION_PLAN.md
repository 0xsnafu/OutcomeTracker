#### Phase 1: Resume News Processing (Priority: HIGH) 🚀
**Target**: Complete remaining news items (~1,000-1,500 remaining)

```bash
cd PromiseTracker/scripts/processing_jobs

# Start with moderate batch to test quota
python process_news_to_evidence.py --limit 200 --start_date 2021-11-21

# If successful, continue with larger batches
python process_news_to_evidence.py --limit 500 --start_date 2021-11-21

```

**Expected Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Expected Result**: News processing 90-95% complete

#### Phase 2: Process Orders in Council (Priority: MEDIUM) 🔄
**Target**: Process 2,727 pending OIC items

```bash
# OIC processing is typically faster and more efficient
python process_oic_to_evidence.py --limit 1000 --start_date 2021-11-21

# Continue in batches
python process_oic_to_evidence.py --limit 1000 --start_date 2021-11-21
# Repeat 2-3 times for all pending items
