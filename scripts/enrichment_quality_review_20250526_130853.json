          "what_it_means": "This promise entails the creation of a specialized research and training institution, a 'Centre of Excellence' (COE), within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to be physically located in Canada. This centre would focus specifically on the intersection of climate change and international security. Its primary purpose would be to conduct research, develop expertise, provide training, and contribute to NATO's understanding and response to the security implications of climate change, such as resource scarcity, extreme weather events, displacement, and their potential to exacerbate conflicts or impact military operations and infrastructure.",
          "background": "NATO Centres of Excellence are multinational or nationally sponsored entities that offer recognized expertise and experience to the benefit of the Alliance, especially in support of transformation. They are not part of NATO's command structure but contribute to NATO doctrine, training, and exercises. NATO has increasingly recognized climate change as a 'threat multiplier' that impacts security, military readiness, and defence infrastructure. This recognition was formalized in NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept, which identifies climate change as a profound challenge that affects the Alliance's security environment. Canada, a founding member of NATO, has long advocated for multilateralism and climate action. This promise, originating from the 2021 Liberal Party of Canada (LPC) Mandate Letters to the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Global Affairs Canada), aligns with Canada's foreign policy priorities of promoting climate action and strengthening international security through collaborative efforts within key alliances like NATO. It reflects a commitment to leverage Canada's expertise in both climate science and security policy.",

          "what_it_means": "This promise commits the Canadian federal government, through the Department of National Defence (DND), to significantly expand the mandate and accessibility of the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre (SMRC). Previously, the SMRC primarily served currently serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) who experienced sexual misconduct. This promise broadens access to include all members of the 'Defence Team,' explicitly encompassing Department of National Defence (DND) civilian employees, Veterans (former CAF members), and the family members of serving military personnel. The goal is to ensure these individuals can access the SMRC's support services, information, and independent advice related to sexual misconduct.",
          "background": "The issue of sexual misconduct within the Canadian Armed Forces and the broader defence community has been a persistent and deeply troubling concern for decades. Multiple independent reviews and reports, notably the 2015 Deschamps Report ('External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces') and the 2022 Arbour Report ('Independent External Comprehensive Review into Sexual Misconduct in the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces'), have highlighted systemic issues, a culture of silence, and a lack of trust in internal reporting mechanisms. The Sexual Misconduct Response Centre (SMRC) was established in 2015 in response to the Deschamps Report, initially to provide independent support, information, and referrals to CAF members affected by sexual misconduct. However, the scope of the problem extends beyond serving members, impacting DND civilian employees, Veterans who experienced misconduct during their service, and military families who may be directly or indirectly affected. The 2021 Liberal Party of Canada (LPC) mandate letters, issued by the Prime Minister to individual ministers, serve as a public declaration of the government's policy priorities and commitments. This specific promise reflects a recognition of the broader impact of sexual misconduct within the defence community and an intent to provide more comprehensive support to all affected individuals, aligning with recommendations for a more victim-centric approach and independent oversight. The 'Defence Team' is a term used by DND and CAF to refer collectively to military members, civilian employees, and their families, emphasizing a unified approach to defence.",

This involves defining who is eligible, how they can access services, and potentially adjusting the SMRC's mandate or operational guidelines to accommodate these new groups. While increased funding would likely be necessary to support the expanded access (e.g., for more staff, resources, outreach), the fundamental action to grant access is a policy change. It is not a new program launch as the SMRC already exists, nor does it inherently require new legislation.",

The core objective is to ensure that government policies and initiatives are designed and evaluated based on their ability to deliver tangible, long-term benefits to Canadians' well-being, extending beyond traditional economic indicators. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for transparent, rigorous, and regular reporting on the progress made towards these quality of life objectives, ensuring accountability and data-driven decision-making.",
          "background": "The 'Quality of Life Framework for Canada' is an initiative championed by the Liberal government, particularly since 2019, to shift the focus of government policy and budgeting beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the sole measure of national progress. It aligns with a global movement towards measuring societal well-being more holistically, incorporating social, environmental, and governance factors alongside economic ones. This framework is inspired by similar initiatives in other countries (e.g., New Zealand's 'Well-being Budget') and is linked to Canada's commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) is the central agency responsible for the overall management of the government, including expenditure management, performance measurement, and reporting. Its role in this promise underscores the government's intent to embed the quality of life framework into core government operations, policy development, and budgetary processes. The inclusion of this promise in the 2021 LPC Mandate Letters signifies its importance as a key priority for the current government.",
